		},
		{

		},

		},
		{

		},
		{

			"senContent": "So is that rock a writeoff?"
		},
		{
			"id": 401803011,

		},
		{
			"id": 401803012,
			"senContent": "Perhaps when your path seems to lead only to doom, carrying on a few steps more will bring you out of the darkness and into the light."

			"senContent": "Is this a continuation to the story from last time?"
		},
		{
			"id": 401803015,
			"senContent": "I should think so. After all, we both just so happen to have free time now."

		},
		{

		},
		{
			"id": 401804002,
			"senContent": "So quickly?"
		},
		{
			"id": 401804003,
			"senContent": "I thought it was pretty normal..."
		},
		{
			"id": 401804004,
			"senContent": "After all, I've picked up a lot of knowledge about precious stones over the years, and my carving skills have gotten better too."
		},
		{
			"id": 401804005,
			"senContent": "However, this accident meant that the original design and plan had to be adjusted, which took a lot of time..."
		},
		{

			"senContent": "And it also meant that all the related plans had to be pushed back to a lesser or greater extent..."
		},
		{

			"senContent": "(Sigh) It's a little hard to bear at times."
		},
		{
			"id": 401804008,
			"senContent": "I mean, it took several years to plan all this. If I had handled things in a more flexible and accommodating way, perhaps it wouldn't have been disrupted."
		},
		{
			"id": 401804009,
			"senContent": "Speaking of which... Does this count as OCD, perhaps? When did you start acting like this?"
		},
		{
			"id": 401804010,
			"senContent": "Huh? Well, I guess you could call it that. Sensibly planning the use of your time is a good habit."
		},
		{

			"senContent": "I'm simply used to being more precise than most people."
		},

			"senContent": "Also, controlling your time is the same as controlling your life."
		},
		{

		},
		{

			"senContent": "I knew it; I wasn't imagining things, you're matching my timetable."
		},
		{

		},

			"senContent": "All that was thanks to my \"OCD\"."
		},
		{

		},
		{
			"id": 401804018,
			"senContent": "Fair enough."
		},
		{
			"id": 401805001,
			"senContent": "Commander, I've finished carving the stone."
		},
		{
			"id": 401805002,

		},
		{
			"id": 401805003,
			"senContent": "It was a pleasant surprise to see that certain colorful inclusions had been mixed into the stone, which was displayed by the cut."
		},
		{
			"id": 401805004,
			"senContent": "Most of those inclusions were white and gray, resembling clouds, and they gave the mountain a sense of life and mysticism, making it look more like a place where heroes would live and train."
		},
		{
			"id": 401805005,
			"senContent": "I guess this stone wasn't a waste after all."
		},
		{

			"senContent": "So why don't you seem very happy about it?"
		},
		{
			"id": 401805007,
			"senContent": "Well spotted, Commander. While the outcome was decent, it is far removed from the initial design."
		},
		{
			"id": 401805008,
			"senContent": "I can't believe I misjudged that stone, and all the designs I had for it were all for naught..."
		},
		{

			"senContent": "Even the item I carved isn't suitable as a gift anymore... It's rather depressing."

			"senContent": "You were going to give it to someone?"
		},

This is a traditional artisan method called \"gold joinery\", where natural lacquer mixed with gold and silver powder is used to seal a break, the philosophy being \"to embrace the damage as part of the item's history and to celebrate it...\" If the repair works, the bangle will be reborn."
